## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Check `package.json` for recommended version, e.g., v18 or later)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Usually comes bundled with Node.js)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dotshell-org/cafeteria-manager
    cd cafeteria-manager
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

*   **Development Mode:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    ```
    This command starts the Vite development server for the renderer process and runs the Electron main process. It typically enables features like Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

*   **Building for Production:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command bundles the React application and prepares the Electron app for packaging. Look for output in a `dist`, `release`, or similar directory as configured in `electron-builder` settings (likely in `package.json` or a dedicated config file).
